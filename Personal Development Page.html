<center><h1>Reflection:</center></h1>
<h3>For the past three to five years I have participated in many programmes and community activities in where I am able to develop my leadership skills.
 One such example is that I am the captain of my community football club. I was also given the chance last month to host a youths program at my church where
I was able to more develop my public speaking skills. One of my newest habits since the start of 2021 is to create a daily "To-Do List" and this has
helped me to complete and finish every task I have set for a day. This new habbit has also served to improve my determination skills.</h3>

<center><h1><a name="Top">12 Pillars:</center></h1></a>
<h3>This book is about a salesman who is dissatisfied with his current situation.
This salesman was on his way to a business meeting when his car broke down.
He didn't have a phone, so he went for a walk to the nearest house.
A large brick and wrought iron fence stretched at least 500 feet along the roadside to this house.
The gate was at least ten feet tall. A house with over 10,000 square feet was hidden behind the gate.
The house was white plantation style with twelve two-story pillars across the front, which made sense given the sign on the side of the gate said "Twelve Pillars."
The salesman met an elderly man who claims he does not own the house, despite the fact that he is the owner, as revealed later in the book.
Instead, he informs the young salesman that he is the yard man for the extremely wealthy man who owns the large house.
They begin a relationship in which the sales rep comes by and meets with the old man for months, and each week the old man teaches
the sales rep a principle of the twelve pillars.</h3>
<h3>The 12 pillars in this book were:</h3>
<ol>
<h3>
  <li>The only way things are going to change for you is when you change.</li><br/>
  <li>You should make sure that the outside of you is a good reflection of the inside of you.</li><br/>
  <li>Time, effort, and imagination must be summoned constantly to keep any relationships flourishing and growing.</li><br/>
  <li>The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.</li><br/>
  <li>Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.</li><br/>
  <li>Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.</li><br/>
  <li>Formal education will make you a living.  Self education will make you a fortune.</li><br/>
  <li>One key to having influence with others is to have others perceive you as a person of talent and virtue.</li><br/>
  <li>What you become directly influences what you get.</li><br/>
  <li>Communication is two or more people working together to find the common ground of understanding.  And when they find that common ground, they are positioned to have tremendous power together.</li><br/>
  <li>To lead others is to help them change their thoughts, beliefs, and actions for the better.</li><br/>
  <li>Live a life that will help others spiritually, intellectually, physically, financially, and relationally. Live a life that serves as an example of what an exceptional life can look like.</li></h3><br/>
</ol>
<h3>Out of these 12 pillars the ones that resinates with me the most are pillars 4-7.</h3>
<ul>
<h3>
  <li>Pillar 4 says that The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.
What I was able to get from pillar 4 is that goal setting is deciding where you want to go and then designing a plan to get you there.
setting goals that stretch you and make you do things differently is what will lead you to a future that you want.
Don’t wait for people to set goals for you.</li><br/>
   <li>Pillar 5 says that  Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity. In chapter 5 it says that we all must suffer from one of two pains: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.
The difference is that discipline weighs ounces and regret weights tons.
Your best opportunity each day are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on.
 Don’t just go through the day, get from the day. Don’t spend you time on urgent, spend your time on what is important.
 We must be our own designer of our lives.</li><br/>
    <li>Pillar 6 states Pillar #6:  Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.
We should all ask ourself these questions:  Who am I around?  What effect are they having on me? What have they got me reading? What have they got me saying? 
Where do they have me going? What do they have me thinking? And most importantly, what do they have me becoming? Then ask yourself the final question: is that okay?
Friends of convenience. This is an interesting concept.  Is it easier to keep certain people for friends, instead of pursuing new friends. 
Successful people look for relationships with other successful people who will push them, challenge them, and encourage them to become better.
 To attract attractive people, you must be attractive. Not physically but mentally and who you are.Your attitude is greatly influenced by the people who you associate with.</li><br/>
     <li>Pillar 7 says that Formal education will make you a living.  Self education will make you a fortune.
Self-education is what you teach yourself. It is what you learn along the way so that you are constantly improving and growing. Most people don’t continue to learn and grow, to separate yourself from everyone else, be focused on continuous learning.

Learning is the beginning of wealth. Learning is the beginning of health. Learning is the beginning of spirituality.  Searching and learning are where the miracle process all begins. Most of life is lived after your formal education. That means the rest of it is up to you.

You have to read the books.  Books are and will continue to be the best learning tools of mankind.</li><br/>

</ul>
<center><h1>Reflection:</center></h1>
<h3>The twelve pillars are interdependent; I can't just focus on one and neglect the others.
The bottom line is that I have a choice about my life, "Make a Living or Design a Life." 
The twelve pillars can be applied in all aspects of my life whether school or business. My favourite pillar would be pillar 6 that says "Don’t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high". 
This is my favourite because I understand that in order for me to grow I need to surround myself with a group of people who can help me develop in the direction I am heading. From now on I will try to be in rooms,groups and situations where I can learn alot from others. I also respect pillar number 9
 that states "What you become directly influences what you get". This is true because most times we are the only ones that are keeping ourselves from achieving certain goals and receiving certain blessings. I am and will continue to always prepare myself/develop myself for good things to come.
The 12 Pillars is a great self development book and I will continue to live by and share all 12 pillars that were highlighted and explained in the text. </h3>
